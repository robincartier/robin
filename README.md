# Portfolio website for my photo work

## Find it at __robin-cartier.fr__

This is a static website 
- uses HUGO as a build 
- Stapi to fetch the data when building it 

Note : it is a work in progress. 

The original website relied only on HUGO, which I found difficult to use to update and organise large amount of picture.

I'm currently experimenting with Strapi to build an easier content update process in the future.
